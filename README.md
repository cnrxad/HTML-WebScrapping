# Web Scraping Script

This repository contains a Python script designed to perform web scraping automatically. Running the script will extract data from a specific web page.

## â–¶ What is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is a technique used to extract information from websites.
It is used to collect large amounts of data from websites, which can be used for data analysis, product development, market research, lead generation, among others.

## â–¶ How does this script work?
This Python script uses several libraries such as Beautiful Soup and Requests to perform web scraping.
Beautiful Soup is a Python library used to extract data from HTML and XML files.
It allows you to parse HTML and XML documents and generate a parse tree for web pages, making data extraction easier.

On the other hand, Requests is a Python library that allows you to easily send HTTP requests, which is useful for obtaining the HTML content of a web page

## âž¡ How to run the script?
To run the script, you will need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you will need to install the necessary Python libraries, such as Beautiful Soup and Requests. You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package installer.

Here is an example of how you can install Beautiful Soup and Requests:

```
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
```

Once you have installed Python and the necessary libraries, you can run the Python script using the following command in the terminal:

```
python index.py
```
### ðŸ”´ Warning
Before performing web scraping on any website, be sure to review the website's Terms of Use and abide by the rules set by the website. Not all websites allow web scraping and some may have restrictions on what you can do with the extracted data. Also, make sure not to overload the website's server with requests as this can cause problems for the website and other users.
